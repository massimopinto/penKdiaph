#   provided here after the data sections and in the README file.

#   CASE DESCRIPTION:
#   Determination of the various correction factors that make up to
#   the k_diaph correction to the primary standard for medium energy
#   x-rays @ENEA-INMRI, Rome, Italy
#   Input file for simulations based on penEasy 2015-05-26

# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
# GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
#
# * Lines starting with a '#' (in column 1) and blank lines are
#   comments. Comments are NOT allowed inside data sections.
#
# * Do not change the order in which sections appear, neither the order
#   of data fields in each section.
#
# * Each data section has a version number of the form yyyy-mm-dd that is
#   written in the corresponding section title. Should an incorrect
#   version be introduced an error message would be issued and the
#   execution halted.
#
# * Character strings (e.g. file names) are introduced in free-format
#   style, that is, leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Their
#   maximum extension (except when noted) is 80 characters and they must
#   not contain blanks. Thus, for instance, 'stainless steel' should be
#   introduced as 'stainlessSteel' or 'stainless_Steel'.
#
# * Most syntax errors can be easily identified by looking for error
#   messages or inconsistencies within the last lines of penEasy output.
#   It is always a good idea to check the output to make sure that the
#   information written after processing each section coincides with what
#   is expected from the input.

#   Set MAT# to zero in the last line to denote the end of the list.
#
# * Use 20 characters at most to introduce the material data file name.
#   Blanks or special characters are not allowed in file names. Thus,
#   instead of "stainless steel.mat" use "stainlessSteel.mat".
#
# * If, for a certain material, the transport parameters after the file
#   name are left empty, then they are set automatically as follows:
#     - Eabs for charged particles are set to 1% of the
#       initial source energy (E), with the limiting values of 50 eV

#     - Eabs for photons is set to 0.1% E with the limiting values of 50

#     - C1 and C2 are both set to 0.1.
#     - WCC is set to min(Eabs(e-),1% E)
#     - WCR is set to min(Eabs(phot),0.1% E).
#     - DSMAX is set to infinity.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TALLY SECTIONS
#
# * Details on the features and configuration of each tally are provided
#   with their documentation (see ~/documentation/*.txt).
#
# * The required RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY that is specified for each tally
#   (except for those that do not have an associated uncertainty, e.g. a
#   phase-space file) is used as a condition to stop the simulation. Only
#   when the requested relative uncertainties of *all* the tallies have
#   been attained the uncertainty condition is considered fulfilled.
#   Recall that the simulation can also be halted because the allotted
#   time or the number of histories requested have been reached. Setting
#   the RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY of all tallies to zero will prevent the
#   execution from stopping for this cause.
#
# * Note for advanced users: when a certain tally scores nothing (i.e.
#   zero) the corresponding REPORT routine reports 0% uncertainty but, at
#   the same time, it reports that the requested uncertainty has not been
#   reached, irrespective of the value introduced in the config file.
#   This is to prevent the simulation from being stopped by a deceptive
#   impression of accuracy in highly inefficient simulations, where the
#   score and its standard deviation after a short period of time can be
#   null.
