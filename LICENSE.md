_PenKdiaph_ is a minor modification of the _penEasy_ package, whose Copyright is owned by Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. Like _penEasy_, _penKdiaph_ is a 'steering program' hinging on the _penelope_ code system used to simulate photons and electron transports towards a free-air-chamber, and thus calculate factors known and _diaphragm corrections_. More information on this is given in the [README.md](README.md) file. _penKdiaph_ is developed by Massimo Pinto of [ENEA-INMRI](http://inmri.enea.it), Italy.
