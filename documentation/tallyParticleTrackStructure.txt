TALLY PARTICLE TRACK STRUCTURE

* This tally allows the representation of particle tracks in a 3D graph. To this end, particle coordinates after each interaction (together with some other information) are written to an external file. This file is used by the corresponding gnuplot script to display the tracks.

* To prevent creating enormous files with myriads of particle tracks that would be virtually impossible to discern when displayed on the computer screen, only a few simulated histories are reported. The number is set by the user in the config file.
