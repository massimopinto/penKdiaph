CONFIGURATION SECTION

* The simulation will be halted when *any* of the following conditions is fulfilled: i) the requested NUMBER OF HISTORIES has been
  reached; ii) the ALLOTED TIME has been exhausted; or iii) the requested relative uncertainties of all the active tallies have
  been reached.

* ALLOTTED TIME is interpreted as real time if it is a positive number. Otherwise, CPU (i.e. user) time is assumed.

* Tallies will write a report to disk once every UPDATE INTERVAL (in s). A dump file will be written to disk once every INTERVAL
  BETWEEN DUMPS.

* Setting both random seeds equal to zero is an indication that they are to be read from an external file, whose name (say,
  rngseeds.in) is read from the next line of input. The two seeds must be on the first line of rngseeds.in separated by one or
  more blanks. This feature is useful when using parallel computing (see README file).

* An OUTPUT DUMP FILE can be defined in the field provided for this purpose. If a valid filename is given, the data generated in
  the current run will be saved (in binary format) in the dump file. This file could then be used in a subsequent simulation as a
  RESTART FILE (see below). Enter '-' in the OUTPUT DUMP FILE field to indicate that no dump file must be generated (this may save
  some CPU time).

* Setting both random seeds equal to -1 indicates that the simulation is to be restarted (that is, continued) from the point where
  a previous run ended. The dump file name of the previous run must be provided in the field named RESTART FILE. If the random
  seeds are not -1,-1 this line is ignored. If this feature is used, the restart file will be read and the simulation will
  continue seamlessly from the point where the previous run had ended.

  IMPORTANT:

  For the former point to be true, the config file must not differ at all from the config file that was used during the simulation
  that created the dump file, with the possible exception of: (i) the requested number of histories; (ii) the allotted simulation
  time; or (iii) the requested relative uncertainties of the active tallies. It is the user's responsibility to make sure that
  this condition is fulfilled---the code does not check if the file has been altered in ways other than the three cases listed
  above. Any alteration of any of the other fields in this file could result in a program crash or, even worse, in a
  miscalculation of some tallies.

* Starting a new simulation or restarting a previous one will overwrite all output data files sitting in the run directory. To
  preserve the results of previous runs, move these output files to a different location.
