TALLY ENERGY DEPOSITION

* The energy deposited per simulated history in each material is reported. Note that the overall uncertainty used to compute simulation efficiency refers to the DETECTION MATERIAL only.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in penEasy.in).
