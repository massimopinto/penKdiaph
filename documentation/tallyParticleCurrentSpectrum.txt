TALLY PARTICLE CURRENT SPECTRUM

* This tally reports, classified according to the particle type, the energy spectrum of the particles that enter the specified DETECTION MATERIAL per unit simulated history. The total number of each type of particle per simulated history is also reported.

* Each particle is counted as many times as it enters the DETECTION MATERIAL. If this feature is not wanted, the absorption energy of the material in question must be set to infinity so that incoming particles are absorbed at once. Note that secondary particles that are generated inside the detection material as a result of an interaction and primary particles that are born inside the detector are NOT counted.

* The energy bins are determined by the EMIN, EMAX (both in eV) and the No. OF E BINS indicated in the config file. To facilitate the preparation of graphs with steps, two energies are printed in each row, namely, the low end and the middle point of each bin.

* The RELATIVE UNCERTAINTY REQUESTED (specified as a percentage) is used as a criterion to decide when to stop the simulation (see Instructions in penEasy.in).
